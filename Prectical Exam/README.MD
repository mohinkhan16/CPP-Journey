# C++ OOP Practical Programs

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains **C++ practical programs** demonstrating core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. These programs were written, compiled, and executed using **VS Code** and **g++ compiler**.

The project is intended for **academic/practical examination purposes** and covers topics such as **classes & objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, and dynamic memory allocation**.

## 📂 Program List

### 🔹 1q.cpp – Student Class (Encapsulation & Constructor)

**Concepts Used:**

* Class & Object
* Private Data Members
* Parameterized Constructor

**Description:**
Creates a `Student` class with private data members and displays student details using a constructor.

**Output Example:**

```
Name: alice
Roll No: 101
Name: bob
Roll No: 102
```

---

### 🔹 3q.cpp – Device Inheritance Example

**Concepts Used:**

* Inheritance
* Protected Members

**Description:**
A base class `Device` is inherited by `Laptop` and `SmartPhone` classes to demonstrate reuse of properties.

**Output Example:**

```
Laptop : Dell 65
SmartPhone : Vivo 20
```

---

### 🔹 4q.cpp – Discount Calculation

**Concepts Used:**

* Class Methods
* Data Encapsulation

**Description:**
Calculates total amount and discount using class member functions.

**Output Example:**

```
total calculate is : 500
total calculate discount is : 1000
```

### 🔹 5q.cpp – Polymorphism with Animals

**Concepts Used:**

* Polymorphism
* Virtual Functions
* Dynamic Memory Allocation

**Description:**
Uses base class `Animal` with derived classes like `Lion` and `Fish` to demonstrate runtime polymorphism.

**Output Example:**

```
lion sound
lion move
Fish move
Fish swim
```

### 🔹 Car Class Program – Setter & Getter Example

**Concepts Used:**

* Encapsulation
* Setter and Getter Methods

**Description:**
Demonstrates setting and displaying car details using member functions.

**Code Snippet:**

```cpp
Car C;
C.set("BMW", 2022, 250);
C.getdata();
```

**Output:**

```
model  : BMW
year   : 2022
model  : BMW
```
