This is a clean and well-structured C++ console application. To make your GitHub repository look professional, a good README.md should explain what the project is, how it works, and how to run it.

Here is a comprehensive template you can copy and paste:

Railway Reservation Management System
A lightweight, console-based Railway Reservation System written in C++. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and the use of the Standard Template Library (STL) vector for data management.

🚀 Features:-

Add New Train Records: Input train details including number, name, source, destination, and timing.

View All Records: Display a formatted list of all trains currently in the system.

Search Functionality: Quickly find specific train details using a unique Train Number.

Dynamic Storage: Uses std::vector to manage records, allowing the system to handle as many entries as memory permits.

🛠️ Concepts Used:-

Classes and Objects: To model real-world entities (Train and RailwaySystem).

Encapsulation: Using private access modifiers to protect data integrity.

Standard Template Library (STL): Utilizing std::vector for dynamic array management and std::string for text handling.

Input/Output Stream: Robust console interaction using iostream and getline.

📋 Prerequisites:-

To run this project, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system:

GCC (MinGW) for Windows

Clang or GCC for macOS/Linux

An IDE like VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion (Optional)
