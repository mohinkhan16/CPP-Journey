📚 Introduction:-

This project demonstrates a Time Converter system written in C++.
It converts:

Total seconds → HH:MM:SS

HH:MM:SS → Total seconds

The program is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, mainly focusing on classes and constructors.

🎯 Objective of the Program:-

The program helps students understand:

How time conversion formulas work

How to design a class in C++

How constructors initialize values

How logic is applied in real programs

🧠 Core Concepts Used :-

🔹 1. Class and Object

The class Timeconverter acts as a blueprint to store and convert time.

🔹 2. Constructor

A default constructor initializes all variables to zero to avoid garbage values.

🔹 3. Data Members

The class stores:

hours

minutes

seconds

total seconds

🔹 4. Member Functions

Each function has a clear purpose:

Convert seconds → time

Convert time → seconds

Display time

Display total seconds

🧮 Theory Behind Conversions:-

⏱ Seconds ➝ HH:MM:SS

1 hour = 3600 seconds

1 minute = 60 seconds

🔎 Why This Program Is Useful:-
